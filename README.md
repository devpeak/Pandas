<h3>What is Pandas?</h3>

Pandas is a Python <em>library</em> used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

 :-> Data Science: is a branch of computer science where we study how to <em>store</em>, <em>use</em> and <em>analyze </em> data for deriving information from it.


What Can Pandas Do?
Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:

Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
What is average value?
Max value?
Min value?
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.
